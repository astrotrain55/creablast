      <p>
        My name is Enesha. And I am a creator, creative copywriter, copywriter (with the job titles
        in the industry being a bit confusing).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a higher education in advertising, MADS school, and years of work in agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        But my path in creativity was not easy: client side, agency side, lots of professions in the
        industry... all of this was confusing and there was no understanding of where to go and how
        to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it gave me the ability <span class="second-font">to work in different conditions</span>
        and quickly understand different topics: from diabetes to cars.
