      My name is Enesha. And I am a creator, creative copywriter, copywriter
      (with the job titles in the industry being a bit confusing).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a higher education in advertising, MADS school, and years of work
      in agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my path in creativity was not easy: client side, agency side, lots of
      professions in the industry... all of this was confusing and there was no
      understanding of where to go and how to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it gave me the ability
      <span class="second-font">to work in different conditions</span>
      and quickly understand different topics: from diabetes to cars.
